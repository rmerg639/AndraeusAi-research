# Evaluation Methodology

Informal testing framework for question variation experiments.

**NOT rigorous. NOT peer-reviewed. Personal experimentation.**

## Tests

1. Ablation: Different variation counts
2. Baselines: Compare to RAG/system prompt
3. Depth: Different complexity tiers

## Notes

- Results vary between runs
- Substring matching evaluation
- Single model tested

**EXPERIMENTAL**
