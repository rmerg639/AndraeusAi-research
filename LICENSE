       this Software on behalf of a client, the CLIENT'S tier applies.

    b) Large enterprises may NOT hire small contractors to build using this
       Software and then take ownership. The end-user/beneficiary's tier
       determines the fee.

    c) Work-for-hire, outsourcing, and consulting arrangements do not

       using this Software must independently obtain licenses.

2D.6 NON-PROFIT CONVERSION PROHIBITION

    a) Converting from for-profit to non-profit status does NOT retroactively
       change tier eligibility or waive accumulated fees.

    b) Non-profits that monetize using this Software remain subject to
       applicable tiers based on their total revenue.

    c) "Non-profit" status is determined by actual operations, not just
       legal designation.

    REGARDLESS OF TIER ELIGIBILITY, the following applies:

    a) ANY entity with Annual Revenue of $500,000,000 AUD or more must pay
       a minimum 2.5% (two point five percent) Large Entity Licensing Fee on net

       all related entities, parent companies, and subsidiaries.

    a) Immediate license termination
    b) Retroactive fees at the highest applicable tier from date of first use
